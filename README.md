# Frontend-frame-for-an-API
### I wrote this frame for a real developer test task of a company.
The `var url` is empty yet, that's why it __***won't work***__ if you click on the buttons. This is because I don't know if the API is public. 
The functions are tested and working .

Issues to fix:
- [ ] the whole styling
- [ ] reengineering the code to "keep it DRY"
